include will run only that particular method and exclude will ignore that particular method
eg:
<class name="may19.Test_004">
                    <methods>
                        <exclude name="Facebook_Testing"/>

                             OR

                        <include name="Facebook_Testing"/>
                    </methods>
            </class>
